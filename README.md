# Foxy.io Customer Portal Authentication Guard

**This Cloudflare Worker is meant to be used with Foxy Customer Portal** : https://github.com/Foxy/foxy-customer-portal

## Overview

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) sit on the "edge" between the Frontend and the Backend.

You can set a Cloudflare Worker to your domain, regardless of where your server lives.

This worker uses [Foxy.io Customer Portal Authentication](https://github.com/Foxy/foxy-customer-portal) to give you the ability to restrict access to certain pages or certain sections of your pages only to authenticated users.

This means you can provide a restricted area even if you are working with a JAMStack application such as 11ty.js, a purely static HTML page or a website running in a third party server.

### Restrict access to pages

- set the `FX_REDIRECT` variable to the Customer Portal page.
- set the routes to be protected in the Workers tab of your domain administration in Cloudflare
    - Go to your domain settings
    - click on the Workers button
    - click "Add route" and set the worker to use and the routes it should be active on

### Restrict access to tags

If you wish to restrict certain tags within a page add a `data-restricted` attribute to the tags you want to restrict.

You may set an empty value to `FX_REDIRECT` if you don't want the user to be redirected.

Example:

```html
<header>
    ...
    <div data-restricted >Welcome back</div>
</header>
<main>
    <foxy-customer-portal endpoint="..."></foxy-customer-portal>
</main>
```

# How to set up

#### Setup Overview

1. Fork this repository
1. Set up GitHub secrets in your forked repository
1. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers using the provided GitHub action

## Fork this repository

Click the "fork" button on the top right of this page. Give your repository a proper name.

This step allows you to use this worker without the need to create a development environment and use `wrangler`.
If you are familiar with `wrangler` you can simply use `wrangler secret` and `wrangler publish` without the need to use GitHub Actions.

## Set up GitHub secrets

In you forked repository, click the "**Settings**" tab, then the "**Secrets**" tab.

Using the "New secret" button create the following secrets:

| Secret              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`     | This is your Cloudflare Id. To get your ID, click the "Menu" next to Cloudflare's logo and, under "Products", click Workers. Your Client ID will be on the right sidebar. [How to get my Cloudflare Id](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/getting-started#6a-obtaining-your-account-id-and-zone-id)                           |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`      | This is your API token. Click the "API Tokens" tab. Select an appropriate token or create a new one. If you'll use an existing, on the rightmost menu choose "Roll" and copy the token. [How to get my Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/getting-started#option-1-obtaining-your-api-token-recommended) |
| `JWT_SHARED_SECRET` | This is the Shared Secret. If you have already configured your Customer Portal, use the same Shared Secret Key. [How to configure my Customer Portal](#how-to-configure-my-customer-portal).                                                                                                                                                   |

If your are using `wrangler` you can configure `JWT_SHARED_SECRET` using `wrangler secret` and use `wrangler config` or `wrangler login` to configure the Cloudflare authentication variables.

## Configuring your worker

On your worker's page, under the `Settings` tab you can edit the variables used by this worker.

You may also configure them using the `wrangler.toml` file.

Look for the line `vars = { ... }` and edit the values your variables:

| Variable      | Description                                                                                                                       | Example                                    | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `FX_REDIRECT` | The URL an unauthenticated user must be redirected to. This is should be the URL where you have the `<foxy-customer-portal>` tag. | '/login'                                   | '/customer-portal'|



### Deploy your worker

- Access the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
- Click the "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" tab.
- Click the "Run workflow" button.

If you wish to deploy to Cloudflare after each push, edit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, and add these lines bellow the second line:

```
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### Configure your Domain

If your domain is not yet using Cloudflare's services, log in to your Cloudflare's account, click the "Add site" button and follow the instructions.

Please note that to use this service you will need to configure your domain to use Cloudflare's nameservers.

When your domain is active, access your domain configuration page by clicking its box in your Cloudflare panel, then click the "Workers" button and finally click the "Add route" button.

This interface will allow you to choose to which pages in your site the worker will be active.

**This worker should be active in all pages you wish to restrict access.**

Example:

Use `customer/*` to protect pages such as `customer/members-only-products` and `customer/reach-out`.

**Be careful with trailing slashes when setting your routes**. [Learn more about matching behaviour of routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/routes#matching-behavior)

# Development

If you wish to customize this Worker, the instructions bellow may be helpful setting up your development environment.

### How to configure my Customer Portal

This document does not aim to explain how to use your Customer Portal.

We're outlining here the basic steps you need to go through to use you Customer Portal in order to help those who are not using that feature yet.

Documentation for the Customer Portal Settings can be found here:

- `https://docs.foxycart.com/v/2.0/customer_portal`
- `https://api.foxycart.com/rels/customer_portal_settings`

You will be using the [Foxy API](https://api.foxycart.com/docs) in order to create your Customer Portal.
You will find it's documentation here:

- https://api.foxycart.com/docs

You can create your Customer Portal following these API links:

`API Home` » `fx:store` » `fx:customer_portal_settings`

Use a PUT or PATCH request to configure your Customer Portal.

In order to use the Customer Portal Authentication Guard you'll need to provide the Guard the `jwtSharedSecret`.

You set this value when configuring the Customer Portal. Please, note that the secret must not be public and must not be shared.

The following OpenSSL command can be used to generate a secret.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 60
```

Set `SSO` to true.

Notice you can check your existing customers using this API path:

`API Home` » `fx:store` » `fx:customers`

You can POST to `fx:customers` to create a new customer to test this Worker.

## Development environment

You'll need `wrangler` to run your worker in a development environment. [View instructions to install it.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update)
You'll need `cloudflared` to view logs from production, if you need it. [View instructions to install it.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/downloads)

Installation instructions are provided here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update

Further documentation for Wrangler can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler).

After installation, authenticate to Cloudflare.

You can do this in one of two ways: with `wrangler login` or `wrangler config`.

- Authenticate with `wrangler login`. It will open a browser for you to authenticate and then ask you to authorize `wrangler`.

```bash
wrangler login
```

- Authenticate with `wrangler config`. First grab your token from your Cloudflare Workers account

```bash
wrangler config
```

### Run a development environment

```bash
wrangler preview --watch
```

### View logs from production (real time)

```bash
wrangler tail --env production
```

You can use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to display a nicely formatted JSON.

```bash
wrangler tail --env production | jq
```

### Setting your JWT Shared Secret with wrangler

You need to use the `wrangler` tool to set up your secret:

Next, set your secret:

```bash
wrangler secret put FX_JWT_SECRET
```

The tool will ask you for your secret. This is the secret you created when setting your Customer Portal.
